## About Us:
We are a group of AI Researchers and Engineers, led by [Dr. Qingsong Wen](https://sites.google.com/site/qingsongwen8/) from [Squirrel AI](https://squirrelai.com/). Motivated by challenging problems arising from industry, we are working on **AI for Education (AI4EDU)** via AI technologies (like LLM, AI Agent, GenAI, Transformer, SSL, GNN, XAI, etc.).
